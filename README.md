**I prefer to code in VS Code over CodePen**
## Steps I took:
### Getting VS ready:
1. Open the folder where you project folder will be saved
2. Use terminal to install Vite `npm create vite@latest` - I selected React and JS
### Minor tweaks to Vite files:
1. Remove the flavicon icon in the head element of the index.html file - personal preference
2. Clear out App.css - here you add your own styles
3. Clear out most of Index.css - I kept some of the root styles (font-family, line-height and font-weight)
5. Delete the content in the return method of App.jsx
### Deploy the project on GitHub Pages:
1. I usually follow the instructions in the blog listed in the Resources below
   - There is a step where you need to add a new .github folder INSIDE your main project folder 
## Resources:
